I'll review the provided code function that uses floor division in Python.

The function `get_quotient(a,b)` performs floor division between two parameters using the `//` operator. Let me analyze its implementation and behavior:

```python
def get_quotient(a,b):
    return a // b
```

## Code Analysis

**Functionality**: This function performs floor division (also known as integer division) on two input parameters and returns the result[1][2].

**Floor Division Behavior**:
- The `//` operator divides the first argument by the second and rounds the result down to the nearest whole number[1].
- It returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to the actual division result[2].
- This operation discards any fractional part of the division result[2].

**Examples of Expected Results**:
- `get_quotient(7, 2)` would return `3` (7/2 = 3.5, rounded down to 3)[2]
- `get_quotient(-10, 3)` would return `-4` (-10/3 = -3.333..., rounded down to -4)[2]
- `get_quotient(13, -2)` would return `-7` (13/-2 = -6.5, rounded down to -7)[2]
- `get_quotient(-9, -4)` would return `2` (-9/-4 = 2.25, rounded down to 2)[2]

## Issues and Improvements

1. **Missing Error Handling**: The function doesn't handle the case when `b` is zero, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Consider adding validation:

```python
def get_quotient(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a // b
```

2. **Missing Type Checking**: The function assumes numeric inputs. While Python's dynamic typing allows for flexibility, you might want to add type hints for clarity:

```python
def get_quotient(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if b == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a // b
```

3. **Documentation**: The function lacks documentation explaining its purpose and behavior. Adding a docstring would improve readability:

```python
def get_quotient(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the floor division of two numbers.

    Args:
        a: The dividend
        b: The divisor

    Returns:
        The floor division result (largest integer less than or equal to a/b)

    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: If b is zero
    """
    if b == 0:
 could benefit from error handling and better documentation to improve robustness and readability.
